===Commands (WAR, MCH, SMN, DRK, DRG, RPR, MNK, RDM, GNB)===

/e /opener

/e /jobguide

/e /opener will skip all intro dialogue. Useful for simply practicing your rotation withouut RP text.

Openers: All Battle Jobs.

Endwalker Guides: WAR, MCH, SMN, DRK, DRG, RPR, MNK, RDM, GNB

===Troubleshooting===

Enable all Battle text in one of the in-game chat tabs.
Ensure that you have at least one text tab that displays /e aka /echo text.
Echo the command to yourself by adding /e before it. Example: /e /opener
Enable Borderless Windowed or Windowed Mode before entering a command.
You do not need to use potions to complete openers.

===Known Issues===

It may take a second or two to stream an overlay for the very first time.

===Performance===

I suspect some of you will worry about the performance cost of the enormous wall of triggers that appear when you import this but not only are triggers locked to each job, they are locked by cascading variables similar to a state machine.

===Credits===

More detailed Credits will be added per Job.
