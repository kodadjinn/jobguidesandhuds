Job Guides and HUDs

===0.50a Changelog===

M O N K
All commands for MNK have been added.
Easily the most mind rattling Job to convey.


===Work in Progress===

Making surprisingly good pace. 50% done in 2 months.
Fatigue is kicking in but this new workflow is solid.
I have faith that once complete, maintainence and even updating to expansions will be far less grueling.


===Commands===

/e /opener   
/e /jobguide   
/e /rotationguide   
/e /endguide 

/e /opener will skip all dialogue. Useful for simply practicing your rotation.


===Endwalker Progress===

Openers: All Battle Jobs.
Endwalker Guides: WAR, MCH, SMN, DRK, DRG, RPR, MNK


===Troubleshooting===

Ensure that you have at least one text channel that displays /e aka /echo text.
Echo the command to yourself by adding /e before it. Example: /e /opener
Enable Borderless Windowed or Windowed Mode before entering a command.
You do not need to use potions to complete openers.
