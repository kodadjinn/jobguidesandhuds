===Setup===

ACT and Triggernomety Plugin Setup: https://imgur.com/a/YCdgK7k

Auto-Update Repo URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kodadjinn/jobguidesandhuds/main/GUIDES.xml

===Commands===

/e /opener

/e /jobguide   

/e /rotationguide  

/e /endguide 

===Troubleshooting===

Enable all Battle text in one of the in-game chat tabs. You do not need to have the Tab selected.
Ensure that you have at least one text tab that displays /e aka /echo text.
Echo a command to yourself by adding /e before it. Example: /e /opener
Enable Borderless Windowed or Windowed Mode before entering a command.
You do not need to use potions to complete openers.

===Known Issues===

It may take a second or two to stream an overlay for the very first time. Images are pulled from imgur and then stored for future use.
This "mod" pins an image over the game and does not directly interface with it. It reads the text log generated by the chat to function.

===Performance===

I suspect some of you will worry about the performance cost of the enormous wall of triggers that appear when you import this but not only are triggers locked to each job, they are locked by cascading variables similar to a state machine.
